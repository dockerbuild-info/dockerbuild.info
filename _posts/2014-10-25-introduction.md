title:  "Introducing this Website"
---

Hello and welcome to my new website! This website is all about docker
and workflows around it. Docker is playing a larger and larger role in
many software development workflows & production build pipelines.
Much of the knowledge is distributed among random teams and
individuals. My team at work is once such team. Maybe you're part of a
team too, or maybe you're a freelancer just trying to ship code.
Regardless we're all in the same point trying to figure out how to
make this work and do it well. Good information is hard to find
especially in a young ecosystem. This site aims to help with that.

This site will provide curated links and community updated pages
around the emerging art of building and shipping docker images. This
new art form involves workflows for testing, deploying,
orchestration, and lest we forget the act of writing a `Dockerfile`!
This is a big space with many things to learn and improve on.

I've created this site to collect three main sources of information:

1. Links: Nothing beats a bunch of helpful and well written
   information
2. Language/Use Case Guides: Docker is an abstract tool. You need help
   knowing how to best apply it to your specific language/framework or
   service.
3. Blog Posts: All docker, all the time. Well written content by
   informed authors.

I'm doing this because I think that docker gives our industry the
chance to make major leap forward. Docker will not be the final
solution to large amount of software engineering problems, but right
now it's the best we've got. I also strongly believe that if you are
greenfielding a new project right now and you are not doing docker you
are doing it wrong. This site should help you do it right. My hope is
that information and experience contained on this website helps you to
improve your development process and ultimate ship better code and be
a happier person. I know the toolchain has done that for me. I also
thinking a rising tide lifts all boats, so share the knowledge and
make things better.

In that spirit, I'm very happy to share my [project template][] with
you. This template has made my workflow much easier and allowed me to
focus on what's important: focusing on the problem at hand. I've also
created the [ruby image guide][]. It's the first on the site, and I
hope that it expands more as time goes on.

Lastly, this website is open source and PRs are encouraged! Submit
links and write image guides--spread the knowledge around.
